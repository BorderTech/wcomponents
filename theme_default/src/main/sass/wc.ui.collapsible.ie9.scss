 * NOTE: we are styling the WDecoratedLabel rather than the SUMMARY to work around a bug in IE8. This is then also
 * applied to IE9 because it has issues with sizing SVG content when using the preferred model.
 * Which causes the browser to crash with a seg fault if you apply the pseudo-element directly to the summary (cool eh?)
