/* wc.ui.panel.action.scss
 * type ACTION
 * From the JavaDoc: "An action panel is similar to CHROME but with a different appearance."
 * OK, so not very useful. The panel will have an exposed title and some decoration (border and/or background).
 *
 * It should be inferred that a WPanel of type ACTION will contain the aspect of the current screen which contains the
 * primary activity of the screen. If this is not able to be determined then this type should probably not be used.
 *
 * This inference leads us to make the ACTION panel into a piece of sectioning content using a SECTION element and set
 * its title as the H1 of the section.
