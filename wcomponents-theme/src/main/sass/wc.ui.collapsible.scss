/* wc.ui.collapsible.scss */
// WCollapsible is a component which consists of a header element and content. The content is shown or hidden according
// to the state of the collapsible. This is a close map of the HTML5 details element in which the header is a summary
// element.

// We only have to style immediate child elements of the collapsible container. In an ideal world we would not even have
// to do this but so far only webkit has native support for <details> and that is still flawed.

// The styles here are purposely minimal and will give you a DETAILS element pretty much like a Chrome default.
