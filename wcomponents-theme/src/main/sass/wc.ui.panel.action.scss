// type ACTION
// From the JavaDoc: 'An action panel is similar to CHROME but with a different appearance.'
// OK, so not very useful. The panel will have an exposed title and some decoration (border and/or background).

// It should be inferred that a WPanel of type ACTION will contain the aspect of the current screen which contains the
// primary activity of the screen. If this is not able to be determined then this type should probably not be used.

// This inference leads us to make the ACTION panel into a piece of sectioning content using a SECTION element and set
// its title as the H1 of the section.
