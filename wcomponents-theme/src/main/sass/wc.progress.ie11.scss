// IE 10 and 11 like big metro progress bars. This is not necessarily a bad
// thing. Big is 280px wide, 10px high. If you like big then remove this file in
// your implementation. It is here to make IEs progress bars the same size as
// those in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
progress {
  height: 1em;
  width: 10em;
}
