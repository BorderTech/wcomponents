// IE does not implement whitespace:pre-wrap in a consistent manner. It appears to not consider multi-byte punctuation
// equivalents (such as &gt;) to be word separators. This can lead to uncontrolled overflow. We have decided to only
// attempt to control this overflow when the textarea is in a WField with its input width set. This gives consuming
// applications a way to control overflow without having internal scroll bars on random text areas.
