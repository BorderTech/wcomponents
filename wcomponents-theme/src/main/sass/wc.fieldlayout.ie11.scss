// IE does not implement whitespace:pre-wrap in a consistent manner. It appears
// to not consider multi-byte punctuation equivalents (such as &gt;) to be word
// separators. This can lead to uncontrolled overflow. We have decided to only
// attempt to control this overflow when the textarea is in a WField with its
// input width set. This gives consuming applications a way to control overflow
// without having internal scroll bars on random text areas.
