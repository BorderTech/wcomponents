// IE 10 and 11 like big metro progress bars. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Big is 280px wide, 10px high.
// If you like big then remove this file in your implementation. It is here to make IEs progress bars the same size as
// those in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

// If you do remove this file, or remove the explicit width, then you should take a look at the faux-progress bars in
// wc.ui.progressBar.ie9.css to make sure you have not proken them.

	height: 1rem;
	vertical-align: -0.2rem;
	width: 10rem;
