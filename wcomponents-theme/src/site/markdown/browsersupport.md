##Default Browser Support

Out of the box WComponents default theme will support relatively modern browsers. **Some** support is provided for
obsolete versions of Internet Explorer which are commonly found in institutional environments for using internal
applications.

###Default support matrix

The latest versions of following browsers are tested and known to work:

* Google Chrome (tested on Windows, OSX, Linux Mint, Android, iOS);
* Firefox (tested on Windows, OSX, Linux Mint);
* Safari (OS X) and Mobile Safari (iPhone and iPad);
* UC on iOS and Android;
* Android browser;
* Internet Explorer 11; and
* Mobile IE on Windows phone 8 (with caveats).

Internet Explorer 8 is known to work and have few CSS issues. There is no default support for IE9 or IE10 but fixes to
known issues from earlier versions of WComponents have been retained.

Other browsers and platforms may be made to work as required. WComponents does not, by default, provide **any** out of
the box support for versions of Internet Explorer before version 8. It may be extended to provide this support within an
implementation. As of February 2015 at least one implementation of WComponents provided support for IE6 (yes, February
2015!).
